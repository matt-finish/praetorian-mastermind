This is the solution to the mastermind challenge found on https://www.praetorian.com/challenges/mastermind

In order to run this, you will need python3 installed along with the python "requests" module. This can be installed by running `pip3 install requests`.

To run the program, go into the Mastermind folder and run `python3 play.py`.

Also make sure to change your email in the `play.py` file to your actual email. 

Once you get the hash you have won. Sometimes you will have to run the program several times to get the correct decision tree outcome. But it shouldn't be more than 3 tries total. Good luck!
